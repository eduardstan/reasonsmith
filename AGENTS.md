# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## The authority

`src/reasonsmith/table7.toml` is a verbatim transcription of Table 7 of *Symbols and Neurons: A
Review of Symbolic XAI in Deep Learning* (Stan, Sciavicco & Napoletano, JAIR 2026, p. 36:22), whose
first author owns this repository. The conformance checks come from Table 19 of the same paper. The
paper is the authority: where a design and the table disagree, the table wins, or the disagreement
is reported as a finding. Do not improve, extend or modernise the wording — the transcription's
value is that a lawyer can check it against the print.

## Dependency

nesyarena supplies the ground-program IR, bounded proof enumeration, the exact WMC oracle and the
adapter protocol. Depend on it; do not reimplement any of those. It is not on PyPI, so
`pyproject.toml` pins it to an immutable commit of the public repo — `pip install -e ".[dev]"` in a
venv is the single install path, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` uses that same one. Never point it
at a sibling checkout or a branch: the measured numbers must stay reconstructible. `torch` is not
installed anywhere here, by decision (see README, "Quick Start"). `tests/conftest.py` puts `src`
on the path so this package itself needs no install, but nesyarena does.

## Two rules that shaped the code

- No emitted record, certificate or measurement may present itself as complete when it is not, and
  every one carries its own limits. See the module docstrings in `evidence.py` and `certificate.py`
  for why each check exists before changing one.
- No check asserts branding, wording or presentation.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
